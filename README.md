# SimonGame
A simple game of simon created using jquery, javascript, html and css. 

Press any key to start the game and then just remember all the patterns that get displayed through flash on buttons. When you enter a wrong pattern the game will be over.

This is an endless game and all paterns displayed are completely random.

Hope you enjoy it ... :)
